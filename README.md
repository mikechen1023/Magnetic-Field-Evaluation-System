## Time : 
2021/3 - 2021/4
## Intro : 
Build a gan network, so that we can use generator to generate trajectory magnetic path, and take discriminator to distinguish the area of the real data.


## Files : 
- gan .py : Build the gan model
- route .py : Calculate CDF
- analysis .py : Show error and uncertainty with picture
- test_gan .py : Test the model
